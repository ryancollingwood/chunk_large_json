# chunk_large_json
Chunk a single BIG json file into many smaller ones

# Overview

Say you've got a large JSON Lines document such as the example below (sourced from: [http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/categoryFiles/All_Amazon_Review.json.gz](http://deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/categoryFiles/All_Amazon_Review.json.gz)

For an exact definition of JSON Lines see: [https://jsonlines.org/](https://jsonlines.org/)
